# Hi There :wave:

#### My name is Jordan Yap, I am a Computer Science student in University of Wollongong currently specializing in Cybersecurity. :grin:

#### This is my Final Year Project which is a Stock Prediction Website. (Graduating in Oct' 2024 :innocent:)

#### I have developed the website using Python with Flask as the web framework and APIs such as *yfinance, pandas, numpy, tensorflow*.

#### You may try out the website if you wish to, I have wrote the instructions below. Enjoy!
#### ***P/S: It may be a little troublesome as you need to have a database.*** 	:flushed:

**Stock Prediction Website (Flask App)**

To run this project;

- Download all the files into a folder 

(DATABASE)
- Create a database named 'market_prophet' in your local MySQL server (e.g. PHPMyAdmin, MYSQL Workbench)
- Select market_prophet as the database in your local MYSQL Server.
- Copy and paste the query from file 'SqlCode.txt' and execute it, to generate the tables and attributes.

(EXECUTING PYTHON FILE)
- Create a virtual environment in your IDE (Python v3.11 preferably)
- Run these 2 commands in Terminal/Powershell:
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- py/python app.py


Once you have run the app, register for an account. You can then search for a stock ticker (e.g. AAPL) and generate the prediction graph!

**_IMPORTANT: You must have a MYSQL database configured locally, MYSQL Workbench/PHPMyAdmin etc._**
